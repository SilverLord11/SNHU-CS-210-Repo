CS-210 5-3 Project Two: Banking Accounting and Tracking README

Summary:
The fictional scenario that led to this project was that bank known as Airgead Bank is partnering with a local high school to 
teach students the concept of fiscal responsibility with an interactive system. With this in mind, I had to start by creating
psuedo-code or a flow chart and use the prompts to devise an objective for my codes. Ther prompts were:

Using C++ create an object oriented programming class (OOP) where people can make individual accounts, as well as input their
initial deposits, any monthly deposits they may put in, and how many years they wish to leave the account. After they do so, 
they may click to the next screen to view the year end earnings with 5% monthly interest for each year.

The class wasn't hard to create, if anything I believe that was the easiest. One way I would improve my code would be implementing 
an ability to create a new class object if the user inputs it, instead of just producing a single class object. Honestly it was the
Function for determining year end earnings over multiple years as well as determining the interest earned that were the most difficult
to write. With all these skills, C++ has become easily transferrable to game programming, which is my future career. Finally, Short-
hand coding, consistent comments, and the use of functions helped to make the code maintainable, readable, and adaptable.
